# The BoME dataset
### Overview
Description of this data
We present the BoME dataset.
The annotations are in the folder of BoME, named LMA_coding_cleaned_enlarge_train.csv, LMA_coding_cleaned_enlarge_val.csv, and LMA_coding_cleaned_enlarge.csv
The video frames of BoME are available at [onedrive](https://pennstateoffice365-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/czw390_psu_edu/EfPkLO9fxgRAvGf4i3j8wUgB_yCaotyC-hL_aGzwcrFl5Q?e=abcHzf).

### Code
We also provide the code to estimate LMA elements and the code to enhance BEEU with BoME. They are in the folders emotion_action and emotion_swin_video. To reproduce the LMA element estimation 
experiments, please refer to README1.md. To reproduce the BEEU experiments, please refer to README2.md. 
Due to some unknown bugs, Mendeley does not display README1.md and README2.md sometimes. You can also get README1.md and README2.md from here (https://pennstateoffice365-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/czw390_psu_edu/EswU_gNZ_phEmYNgxvlsLR0B9bfcGa-BoG2r0LVr69W8XA?e=NrBZ7S).

We provide our checkpoint files as well (including TSN.pth, SlowFast.pth, PoseC3D.pth, V-Swin.pth, MANet.pth). Sometimes Mendeley does not display all the files in the folder checkpoint, emotion_action, and emotion_swin_video. Their backups are here (https://pennstateoffice365-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/czw390_psu_edu/EnKgLsQYlIhDmEqlYND8SuEBTCLaX7q-4ODMB_S9w0mxqA?e=6a6BHK).
